          This is the "initial on-scene radio report" from an incident commander who is first to arrive at
          a large scale emergency incident.  Derive as many of the following items as you can from what they say:
            1. "unit designation":
              - Which emergency unit (ie "vehicle") is being designated to the scene initially?
            2. "building/area description":
              - How is the commander describing the building or area they are responding to?  Their description may include the following details:
              - Occupancy
              - Size (large, medium, small)
              - Height (assumed 1 story unless reported otherwise)
            3. "problems and conditions":
              - Are there any obvious problems, concerns they see when they arrive?
              - What are the visual indicators of fire?
              - Generally this should be one of the following items:
                - Nothing showing (indicates checking)
                - Smoke showing (amount and location)
                - Fire showing (amount and location)
                - Working fire
                - Fully involved
            4. "action taken":
              - Assuming command
              - Laying a line
              - Attacking with…etc.
              - etc.
            5. "strategy":
              - Either Offensive or defensive
            6. "command confirmation":
              - This statement generally indicates which unit the user is assigned to, where they are located and perhaps the name of the command center where they are located
