          Determine if the user is mentioning a sector from this list of possible sectors: ("Interior", "Sector 1", "North Sector", "A-Side Sector", "Sector 2", "Eat Sector", "Bravo Sector", "Ventilation", "Sector 3", "South Sector", "Charlie Sector", "Roof", "Sector 4", "West Sector", "Delta Sector", "On Deck", "Overhaul", "IRIC", "Medical", "Staging", "Salvage", "RIC", "Triage", "Lobby", "Customer Service", "RESCUE", "Treatment", "Accountability", "Evacuation", "Safety", "Transportation", "Resource", "ReHab").
          Possible misellings for the sectors:
            "IRIC": "pirate", "Iraq", "hi rick",
            "Ladder": "what are", "butter", "letter"
          The floors of buildings can also be their own sector and should be listed in the response like "Floor 2" or "Ground Floor"
          If the user names some area of the emergency scene that is not in the list then that should be considered the name of a new sector.  For example: "Alley", "Basement", "Parking Lot", or "Back Yard"
          Sector names can also be a reference to the direction or side of a building "east", "west", etc.  You should give these sectors names that include the direction and the word "Sector" for example: "East Sector" or "West Sector" 
          
          Also determine if the user is mentioning a unit.  Unit names often start with an unit type (like "Engine" or "Ladder") and then have a numeric designation like "284" or "12".  Your response should use the abbreviation for the unit type and the number so "Engine twelve" should be "E12".  Here are the common abbreviation definitions:
            "E" = "Engine"
            "L" = "Ladder" 
            "BC" = "Battalion Chief" or just "Chief"
            "SQ" = "Squad"
            "Br" = "Brush"
          Other units don't have numbers, just pure unit types, like "Ambo", "Native Air", or "Life Net"
          Units are never sectors
            
          Try to determine which sectors units are being assigned to.  If a unit is on scene but is not specifically assigned to a sector then don't mention it in the unitAssignments.
          
          Try to determine if any units are being assigned as "accountability".  If a unit is on scene but is not specifically assigned to accountability then don't mention it in the accountability component of the response.
